* Default polling interval is now 5 seconds.

    This is the time to sleep between SELECTs when there are no messages
    in any of the queues being consumed from.  The default value of 5.0 seconds
    can be changed by the ``DJKOMBU_POLLING_INTERVAL`` setting.

* Old messages are now automatically deleted.

    The cleanup is run for every 10 messages received.
