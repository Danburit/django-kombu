:release-date: 2011-02-28 16:0 A.M CEST

* Default polling interval is now 5 seconds.

    This is the time to sleep between SELECTs when there are no messages
    in any of the queues being consumed from.  The default value of 5.0 seconds
    can be changed by the ``DJKOMBU_POLLING_INTERVAL`` setting.

    Previously it would issue 10 selects a second, so this will result in
    considerably less CPU usage, but also it means that it can take a lot
    longer for a task to be processed.  If this is not acceptable to your
    needs you should increase the polling interval accordingly.

* Old messages are now automatically deleted.

    The cleanup is run for every 10 messages received.
